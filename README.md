## -Taco.Nvim-

The Department of Neovim Configuration Efficiency has decided that [kickstart.taco](https://github.com/tacolegs2004/kickstart.taco) is bloated and is in desperate need of restructuring. Thus, we have decided to completely overhaul it and keep it contained to **one file**, inspired (and stolen) by [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).
